# ReactJS project that incorporates a simple game of Rock Paper Scissors, a leaderboard table for ranking players, a CRUD functionality for user profiles, and registration and login features. It also includes a layout consisting of a footer and a navbar for wrapping the entire page and handles data fetching to a server.

**The ReactJS project** is designed to provide an engaging and interactive experience for users. The centerpiece of the project is a game of Rock Paper Scissors, a classic hand game where players choose between three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The game is implemented using React components and allows users to make their selections and see the outcome. The logic behind determining the winner or a tie is handled within the React components.

In addition to the game, the project features a leaderboard table that displays the ranking of players based on their performance in the Rock Paper Scissors game. The leaderboard is dynamically updated as players complete matches, and it provides a visual representation of the top performers.

The project also includes a user profile functionality that allows players to create, update, and delete their profiles. Users can register and log in to the application using secure authentication mechanisms. The **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the profile enable users to customize their information and manage their accounts effectively.

To ensure a consistent and user-friendly experience, the project incorporates a layout that includes a footer and a navbar. The layout is designed to wrap the entire page, providing a cohesive and visually appealing interface. It allows users to navigate between different sections of the application easily and access important features.

Lastly, **the project integrates with a server to handle data fetching and persistence**. This ensures that user information, game results, and leaderboard data are stored securely and can be accessed across multiple sessions. The server communication is implemented using APIs and the appropriate data fetching libraries in React, enabling seamless interaction between the frontend and backend components.

**In summary, this ReactJS project combines a simple game of Rock Paper Scissors with a leaderboard table, user profile CRUD operations, and registration and login features. It incorporates a layout for better user experience and handles data fetching to a server for seamless data management. The project aims to provide an enjoyable and interactive experience for users while maintaining the necessary functionality for user management and data persistence.**



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
